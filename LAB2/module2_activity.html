    <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Thousands of protesters marched through the capital city of the Philippines on Sunday, September 21, 2025, to express their anger over a major corruption scandal. The demonstrators are furious about a bogus flood-control project that they believe has wasted billions of pesos in public funds.
While the rally began peacefully, it escalated into violence when riot police deployed water cannons against a group of mostly young, masked individuals. In response, these individuals hurled rocks and shattered the glass of a police outpost.
The clash led to the arrest of 72 people, including 20 minors. During the confrontation, at least 39 police officers were injured, and a trailer that was being used as a barrier was set ablaze. The protest highlights the public's growing frustration with government corruption and the alleged misuse of taxpayer money for fake infrastructure projects.</p>
